      <title>Day 2 - Mobile Friendly Blog</title>
      <link>http://kylir.com/100-cool-things/2013/11/25/mobile-friendly.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Things are not off to a good start. In fact, I missed a day&amp;#8230; or eight&amp;#8230; before I did today&amp;#8217;s cool thing. One problem is I haven&amp;#8217;t made time in my schedule to actually do something cool to post here. So I&amp;#8217;ve finally rearranged my schedule and I&amp;#8217;ve freed up an hour that I can dedicate to this goal. I&amp;#8217;m getting up at 4:00 AM (seriously, that&amp;#8217;s not a joke!) and working out for an hour. After getting ready, I try to get on making my cool thing by 6:00 AM. At 7:00 AM I start my day job, then at 3:00 PM I do side work for a couple hours. Once I get home, hopefully around 5:00 PM, I disconnect completely and spend quality time with the family until 8:30 PM, at which time I hit the sack. Rinse. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Day 3 - RSS Feed</title>
      <link>http://kylir.com/100-cool-things/2013/11/25/rss-feed.html</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, today&amp;#8217;s cool thing happened a lot more smoothly than yesterday&amp;#8217;s. Originally I wanted to make a quick website for an annual paintball tournament that I do each year. However, there&amp;#8217;s some graphics and a sweet video that I want to make for it first, so it&amp;#8217;ll have to wait until another day. I decided instead to add an &lt;a href='https://github.com/agelber/jekyll-rss'&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; to my site. Adding the feed to my site was amazingly easy and simple. I made a &lt;em&gt;plugins folder, dropped the Ruby script from GitHub into it, set some values in my&lt;/em&gt;config.yml file, and added a RSS link to my pages. Whammo sammo, I&amp;#8217;m done! Unfortunately, GitHub doesn&amp;#8217;t allow plugins (for obvious security reasons), so for now I&amp;#8217;m manually copying the generated RSS feed into my GitHub repo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
