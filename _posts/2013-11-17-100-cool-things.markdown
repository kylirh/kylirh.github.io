It has been done [before][365-cool] and by [many][180-websites] [others][30-before-30]. Now I'm going to do it as well. One cool thing every day for 100 days!

Today is Day 1 and I'm kicking things off by adding a Jekyll blog to my website. Woot!

Now what will tomorrow bring...? Well, I haven't even thought about that yet...

**11/25/2013 UPDATE** - I'm off to a bad start! I never even made it to Day 2. Time to pick myself up, dust off, and get back on the horse. I've rebooted and made a post for [Day 2]({% post_url 2013-11-25-mobile-friendly %}).
