Things are not off to a good start. In fact, I missed a day... or eight... before I did today's cool thing. One problem is I haven't made time in my schedule to actually do something cool to post here. So I've finally rearranged my schedule and I've freed up an hour that I can dedicate to this goal. I'm getting up at 4:00 AM (seriously, that's not a joke!) and working out for an hour. After getting ready, I try to get on making my cool thing by 6:00 AM. At 7:00 AM I start my day job, then at 3:00 PM I do side work for a couple hours. Once I get home, hopefully around 5:00 PM, I disconnect completely and spend quality time with the family until 8:30 PM, at which time I hit the sack. Rinse. Repeat.

Totally sustainable. There's no way I can fail now, right?

Anyway, on to today's cool thing. After adding a blog to my site for [Day 1]({% post_url 2013-11-17-100-cool-things %}) I noticed it looked kind of wonky on a mobile device, something like this:

I went through the various pages and tweaked them all to be pretty decent looking on my iPhone, iPad, and desktop machine. There's a bit of responsive design baked in too. I think it is good enough for now. What do you think?
