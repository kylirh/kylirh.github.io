## Hello, I'm Kylir Horton

I'm a developer, photographer, and tech enthusiast with a passion for creating digital experiences that bring ideas to life. With a background in software engineering and a love for visual storytelling, I blend technical skills with creative thinking to build engaging products and capture compelling images.

### Professional Background

I have extensive experience in web development, focusing on modern JavaScript frameworks, responsive design, and user experience. I enjoy tackling complex problems, optimizing code performance, and delivering clean, maintainable solutions. My approach to development is detail-oriented, focusing on both functionality and aesthetics.

### Photography

Photography has been a significant creative outlet for me for many years. I'm drawn to a variety of subjects - from urban landscapes and architecture to portrait and abstract work. Through photography, I explore composition, light, and perspective to capture moments that tell a story.

### Personal Interests

Beyond coding and photography, I'm passionate about:

- Exploring new technologies and staying current with industry trends
- Outdoor activities like hiking and rock climbing
- Reading books on technology, design, and science fiction
- Travel and experiencing different cultures
