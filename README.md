Kylir's Website
===============

This is my website. You can find it at kylir.com. It is powered by Jekyll and GitHub.

This entire blog, its contents, graphics, code, etc. are uncopyrighted. That means I've put them in the public domain and released my copyright on all of these works. There is no need to get my permission to use content I produce. Use it however you want! Email it, share it, reprint it with or without credit. Change it around, put in horrible swear words and attribute it all to me. It's OK.

Attribution is appreciated, but it is not required.

Uncopyright
===========

I'm not a big fan of copyright law. I could write about it until my face turns red, but I think [Leo Babauta][1] from [Zen Habits][2] wrote it best on his [Uncopyright page][3]. Read about his stance on copyright (which I share) and then seriously consider removing it from what you create as well.

I believe the world would be a better place without copyright. Release control. Allow people to be people and believe in the goodness that is in all of us. That's what uncopyright is really all about.

Well, thanks for stopping by!
