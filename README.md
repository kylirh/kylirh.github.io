Kylir's Website
===============

This is my website. You can find it at kylir.com. It is powered by Jekyll and GitHub.

My website and blog along with its contents, graphics, code, etc. are uncompyrighted. That means I am putting them out into the public domain and releasing my copyright on all of these works. There is no need to get my permission to use content I produce. Use it however you want! Email it, share it, reprint it with or without credit, change it, put in horrible racial slurs and attribute it all to me. It's OK.

Attribution is appreciated, but it is not required. I also would love to know how you've used my work!
