<font color="#993399"><b>A painful pleasure, the consequence of choice.</b></font><br><br>
Pain is something that nobody likes,<br>
which is a shame.<br>
Pleasure is something that everyone seeks,<br>
that is stupidity.<br><br>
Does pain provoke us to seek pleasure?<br>
Or perhaps pleasure causes us to avoid pain?<br>
However it is seen,<br>
it is carnal.<br><br>
Carnal is some given at creation.<br>
What is done with that is up to the individual.<br>
But, there is something greater.<br>
It is to Control, to Become,<br><br>
to Grow.<br>
There is a plan, purpose, and structure to life.<br>
It is to live by not only experience,<br>
but by overcoming the weakness within.<br><br>
Step into my dream world now.<br>
Reality once was mankind�s own ignorance.<br>
Now, see that there?<br>
Yes, it is pain.<br><br>
So big, but it�s only a feeling.<br>
See that, it�s pleasure.<br>
So small?<br>
Yes, but it�s only something you don�t really need.<br><br>
Wouldn�t it be great if there were no desires<br>
to seek pleasure and to shun pain?<br>
If the desires of the heart was to do right,<br>
instead of instinctual desires?<br><br>
What if pain was eaten like candy,<br>
and pleasure vomited like poison?<br>
Then what would stop humanity?<br>
Ha! Ha! Only the limits of a mind.<br><br>
But see here,<br>
in reality, there is no reality.<br>
It is us and what we make of it.<br>
You are your world.<br><br>
You are in control.<br>
So control carnal desires<br>
given at birth.<br>
Overcome through desire and choice.<br><br>
For you choose your fate,<br>
either a bullet to the head<br>
or a stroke at night in bed.<br>
Success or happiness.<br><br>
You make reality as you go.<br>
Change it.<br>
Make it something where you do what is right.<br>
Something which is more that what you want.<br><br>
Don�t seek pleasure and avoid pain<br>
or visa versa.<br>
Seek for what is right.<br>
What is best.<br><br>
Remember:<br>
Desire,<br>
Overcome,<br>
Choice.<br><br>
In life there are only two things that are sure:<br>
Consequence<br>
and<br>
Choice<br><br>
We choose the consequence<br>
based on our actions/thoughts.<br>
We�re in full control.<br>
We choose our fate.<br><br>
If only we could see far enough to do what�s right,<br>
right now,<br>
right here.<br>
Choose thy fate, mortal� and choose it well.<br><br>
