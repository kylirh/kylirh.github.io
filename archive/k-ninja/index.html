	K-NINJA<br>
By Kylir Horton<br><br><br>
It all began on October 24,1981...A child was born in Provo, Utah , the parents named the child Kylir A. Horton.One year later Kylir was a blond boy ,Kylir was happy and bright .Eight years went by and Kylir was nine , before Kylir was ten he moved to Florida , it was very different from Utah! One month later he was going to a school called H.L .Johnson, it had more kids at the school than any ware else. One year later Kylir had amnesia; the doctors had to make Kylir into a robot , but the doctors forgot one micro chip so Kylir was not himself anymore- he knew everything , he still acted like Kylir.He still talked like Kylir the only thing that was different was that he knew everything. Eight years passed and all Kylir did was fight crime in Florida. One day Kylir gave himself a new name:<br>
K-NINJA<br>
the (K) standed for Kylir and he always wanted to be a ninja and now he is...Two years later Kylir moved to California. He made L . A . his own base and nobody knew K-NINJA . Two years later the mayor of L .A . was curious about the crime in the city, the crime had completely gone away nobody ever got robbed or hurt anymore ,the cops didn't work any more. One day a tourist went into the mountains and saw Kylir, he new the secret about K-NINJA , he went back to the city and he told the mayor but the mayor didn't believe the tourist . The next day the tourist went looking for his super hero to find out his name but at the end of the day he didn't find the hero. The tourist looked for Kylir for weeks and he never found K-NINJA. The tourist looked for Kylir one more time, at that time he found KYLIR and thought of a plan , his plan was that he would make a hole and when Kylir stepped in the hole he would get stuck in the hole and he would have chains on him and I would ask him what his name is . The tourist did that and found Kylirs name and left Kylir in the hole .The next day the tourist went to the hole Kylir was not there he was gone the tourist went to KYLIRs base he was not there either...Twelve years later K-NINJA was not anywhere.The year was 2015.On October 23 TH right ware the Ecliptic line was ,the Equator line was and Equinoctial colure line was .A man was on a boat and it was just about to change to low tide right at that very second a island blow out of the water and water flew evryware .The island was huge and it was butiful but it couldn't have life on it because it was under water and theirs a big dome all most covering the hole island.The man went to the island to see if their was any people their.When the man was just about done looking at the island he ran into a guy that was warring black clothinng the man sead are you ok but the other man grabed hes neack and lifted the ather man up the man that was in black close was the K-NINJA .The K-NINJA sead how did you get her the man sead he wanted to see if aneone was her the k-ninja wasnt happy sow he let the man go.One year later...</font>
