After this far, one would think that he couldn�t barely run.<br>
The challenge too much to bear, except for the elite few.<br>
But you�re wrong, for him pain is glory�dying is fun.<br>
A repose is not the broth he drinks from the brew.<br><br>
He�s fallen with each stride, soared with each step.<br>
The coming of the dark storm is the return of the blue sky.<br>
He crawls with power, sprints at a creep.<br>
He�s jumped so low and fallen so high.<br><br>
But he�s wrong, glory is forever and pain is temporary.<br>
A paradox, perhaps, or so it seems.<br>
Soaring as a trapped eagle, plummeting as a free canary.<br>
Or so it all is in our own dreams.<br><br>
His marathon is the existence of life among all human kin.<br>
His glory through pain is the life we seek. We deserve.<br>
His joy when finishing the race within,<br>
is the object a singular mortal wishes to serve.<br><br>
The race is to know the truth and then to find it,<br>
it is to discern<br>
The race is to rise each time you�re fallen,<br>
it is to return.<br><br>
And when I find him, the finisher of a marathon, I�ll look into his face.<br>
Mirrored in him I�ll see that it�s me who runs the race.<br>
The potential currently resides in my pace.<br>
If I finish, there is no ultimate disgrace.<br><br>

At the finish line, I know at least one question will remain to be answered,<br>
being too great of an enigma to reason out and not acquire a brain-burn:<br>
If a Smurf were choking,<br>
what color would he turn?<br><br>
