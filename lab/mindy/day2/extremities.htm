One day, it was a blue, blue sky.<br>
The warmth was there, it became part of the hawk.<br><br>
It’s wings had potential in them.<br>
They would shine after a cleaning from the recent rain.<br><br>
Today, the hawk would steer away from those dark clouds<br>
while on it’s search for food.<br><br>
Today, the hawk would rise higher and go farther than ever before<br>
while on it’s search for food.<br><br>
It would find it’s food, no matter where it was.<br>
The hawk has black feathers, no one knows why they are black.<br><br>
The black hawk, it wants to feed, it is hungry.<br>
So it has to fly higher and father than it has ever gone before.<br><br>
For the glory, for the happiness, for the hunger of that meal.<br>
No, no. To escape from the hunger, from the pain, from the shame.<br><br>
Two extremities meet. Annihilate each other.<br>
It is something less than nothing which takes their place.<br><br>
Two things which are tangible and touchable.<br>
Something real, something like that black hawk.<br><br>
The two elements form the absence which cannot be filled even with nothing.<br>
A pure void.<br><br>
Down to the darkness, back to coat the hawk’s wings with it’s pure void.<br>
The dark storm has risen. The black has come for more.<br><br>
The black hawk stands against the dark sky as a white star.<br>
Now is his time to shine. No, now is his time to fall.<br><br>
The white hawk, glorified by the darkness engulfing it.<br>
It struggles for a second, then allows it’s feathers to be darkened once again.<br><br>
Next time, he’ll fly higher and farther to get his food.<br>
So that next time, he’ll get his food.<br><br>
The warmth of the sun on a blue, blue day is so nice.<br>
It’s almost as nice as eating after the dark storm has been conquered.<br><br>
