<P><IMG SRC="bwords.jpg" ALT="Da Bacon World" HEIGHT=55 WIDTH=315><IMG SRC="me02.JPG" ALT="Me as a Lad!" HEIGHT=324 WIDTH=174 ALIGN=LEFT>Hey
yal! Yup, I sure-do welcome yer ta da country-back-stalling-buck-spittin-waterhole-kinda-fun-place
we here call da Bacon World! Dat dere is a picture of me when I wuz a out
in der fields paintin' fences all day as a young sturdy hound dog! Didn't
git too dang dog much done dough, cause for some dawg gonit reason, da
fence would never git any dang flee shootin paint on it. Oh well, I guess
I really didn't need to paint dat dere fence all pretty and dandy like
how I roast me bacon.</P>

<P>Now, wait dere just a dawg gonnit minute dere son! Don't loose a interest
in me so soon. I got a story here ta tell ya, and it's all 'bout me ssswwwwweeeeeeetttttt
bacon! Mmm, mmm! I can just taste it now.</P>

<P>Let me start off by tellin yall a little bout da history here. Ya know,
bacon jerky wasn't always around yer know. Yes sirry! It's come a long
way since da indianos. Why, I can't remember a time when I wasn't here
a thinkin about me bacon. It all started with da indianos, but soon, sure
dang enoungh, here came da white folks wanton ta steel deir land and eat
deir animals. Well, if yer didn't know, I'd say,&quot; Well, geez, partner!
Don't cha know dat da buffalo was da main source of food for dat them dere
indians?&quot;</P>

<P>Well, ya see here, dere were no cows and cowboys up and runnin 'bout,
so da indians made deir famous good didily umpcious, deliciousiouceiny
yessirry, buffalo jerkey, which is second ta beef jerky, but that wasn't
around back in the 1450's. Well, yer see here, da rednecks took over, that
is da white people or folkies as I here like ta call em. Dey were sooo
hungry dat dey ate everythin' in site o a dawg gonit mile, den dey ripped
down da tropical rain forests o Oklahomi and built Oklahomi City! Yes,
dey did all dat and more in da year of 1877.</P>

<P>Dey brought da cowboys and cows and other thingys along da following
year, 1566. Den dere was a indiano named Jakafildil Akakafan Mijlaman Fliripiuto
<IMG SRC="piggy.JPG" ALT="This is me Piggy!" HEIGHT=170 WIDTH=160 ALIGN=RIGHT>Monofimao,
dat translates ta Bacon Butt in English. Now yer see here, good ol' Jakafildil
Akakafan Mijlaman Fliripiuto Monofimao got his namo from bringin' da pig
over ta here in Europa, where he started da biggest piggy farm on dis here
side o da Mississippi in da year 2096. People say dat he was called Bacon
Butt because he brought bacon into theIndiano world and killed masses upon
masses o Indianos with his heavily colestoral accumalating dish o bacon,
so da Gods or sombody got mad at him and made him turn half pig, and cursed
him ta be dat way forever, unless he did a major thingy-dingy for da indianos.
Well, yer see here he thought and thought and thought a little bit o' more,
and then he seys, &quot;By gosh-dang-doodaly-donkey! I'll give dat dere
bacon to da rednecks!&quot;</P>

<P>And he did, and den he dere turned back inta a dawg gonnit Indiano,
yea-haw! And dat's how bacon was introducted inta our here, dat there,
culture o meat eatin' humanios! Now, dis is when I kick in. I here specialize
in making bacon jerky, since all da cows are insane from dat dere mad cow
disease or somethon'. Let me tell ya da ingrediants dat go inta every slab
o bacon jerky!</P>
