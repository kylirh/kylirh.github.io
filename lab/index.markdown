##Here's some random samples of code. They're mostly JavaScript and CSS. Look at <a href="https://github.com/kylirh">GitHub</a> and <a href="http://codepen.io/kylirh">CodePen</a> for a few more nuggets.
<ul>
     <li>
          <a href="reveal">More Scrum Reveal Slides</a><br />
          More slides for another Scrum Reveal. Uses <a href="http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js">reveal.js</a>.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="customer">ExtJS Sample App</a><br />
          An ExtJS 4 app that uses their MVC framework. Fun stuff.
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="paintball">Paintball Party Website</a><br />
          A simple Bootstrap-based website I made to organize an event with some friends. Check out the responsiveness of it too! Also, the image of Chang keeps its proportions as the page is scaled up and down. Tricky tricky!
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="april-scrum">April Scrum Reveal Slides</a><br />
          Some slides for a Scrum Reveal.

     <li>
          <a href="error">Application Error Page</a> and <a href="/404.html">404 Error Page</a><br />
          An application and 404 error page. The 404 error page is the actual error page used on this site.
     </li>
</ul>
