	  My dearest Mindy,<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am so very sorry for the cruel, distasteful practical joke that was played
	  on you yesterday, but you've got to admit that it was pretty dang good! But,
	  no, really, I am sorry. I am further sorry that you like a guy who thinks
	  being mean and playing cruel jokes is a form of flirting. I am so horrible!
	  Your life has probably become most unbearable and quite miserable indeed.<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, today I have dedicated myself to making it up to you. I know
	  that I'm around 362 screw ups by now, and that we've only been together this
	  long because of your grace and mercy. I can only hope that the count will
	  be decremented to 361 and that perhaps it'll be down to maybe 347 by Sunday,
	  if things go well.<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above I have attempted to render a painting of you and your most awesome
	  sister. Yes, I know you can't tell who is who, but really I tried! And to the right
	  you will find some poetry that I like and some that I've written. I've always wanted to show you
	  this stuff, and now I've finally gotten around to it. Just remember why I
	  wrote some of these poems and please don't be too weirded out. Also included is my
	  favorite poem of all time ever in the universe! (And that would be the first one)<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after you traverse all these poems, I hope that you will find the CLUE
	  that I left! It's real hard to find! You may have to go through a lot of crud
	  to get it though!<br>
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, enjoy this stuff for what it's worth. You are priceless!<br><br>
