<font color="#6666CC"><b>Mission Statement</b></font><br><br>
Always encourage others' dreams,<br>
but never tell them what to do.<br>
Never cease Changing<br>
and Growing for the Better.<br>
Never Willingly Do Something Easy,<br>
but yet Just Do It.<br>
While Work is Hard,<br>
so is a Balance in Life.<br>
Therefore, always remember<br>
and live by Your Principles First,<br>
for this is the only way to<br>
Develop Integrity and Character.<br>
Live each day of Life<br>
like it were your Last,<br>
never forgetting the<br>
Pursuit of Perfection.<br>
Excellence is a series of Good Habits,<br>
and so are Goals.<br>
So Conquer and Command your<br>
Habits, Time, and Appetites.<br>
Keep in Mind that only through<br>
Choosing to be Happy, Kind,<br>
Well-Rounded, and Disciplined<br>
will you achieve Ultimate Success.<br><br>
Choose thy fate, mortal... and choose it well.<br><br>
