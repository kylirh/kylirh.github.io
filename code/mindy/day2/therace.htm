	"Quit! Give up you’re beaten!"<br>
They shout at me and plead.<br>
"There’s just too much against you now<br>
This time you can’t succeed!"<br><br>
And as I start to hang my head<br>
In front of failure’s face.<br>
My downward fall is broken by<br>
The memory of a race.<br><br>
And hope refills my weakened will<br>
As I recall that scene.<br>
For just the thought of that short race<br>
Rejuvenates my being.<br><br>
||&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>
A children’s race; young boys, young men<br>
How I remember well.<br>
Excitement, sure! But also fear<br>
It wasn’t hard to tell.<br><br>
They all lined up so full of hope<br>
Each thought to win that race.<br>
Or tie for first, or if not that<br>
At least second place.<br><br>
And fathers watched from off the side<br>
Each cheering for his son.<br>
And each boy hoped to show his dad<br>
That he would be the one.<br><br>
The whistle blew and off they went<br>
Young hearts and hopes afire.<br>
To win and be the hero there<br>
Was each young boy’s desire.<br><br>
And one boy in particular<br>
Whose dad was in the crowd.<br>
Was running near the lead and thought:<br>
"My dad will be so proud!"<br><br>
But as they speeded down the field<br>
Across a shallow dip.<br>
The little boy who thought to win<br>
Lost his step and slipped.<br><br>
Trying hard to catch himself<br>
His hands flew out to brace.<br>
And mid the laughter of the crowd<br>
He fell flat on his face.<br><br>
So down he fell and with him the hope<br>
—He couldn’t win it now—<br>
Embarrassed, sad, he wished<br>
To disappear somehow.<br><br>
But as he fell his dad stood up<br>
And showed his anxious face.<br>
Which to the boy so clearly said:<br>
"Get up and win the race."<br><br>
He quickly rose, no damage done.<br>
—Behind a bit that’s all—<br>
And ran with his mind and might<br>
To make up for his fall.<br><br>
So anxious to restore himself<br>
—To catch up and win—<br>
His mind went faster than his legs:<br>
He slipped and fell again!<br><br>
He wished then he had quit before<br>
With only one disgrace.<br>
"I’m hopeless as a runner, now;<br>
I shouldn’t try to race."<br><br>
But in the laughing crowd he searched<br>
And found his father’s face.<br>
That steady look which said again:<br>
"Get up and win the race!"<br><br>
So up he jumped to try again<br>
—Ten yards behind the last—<br>
"If I’m to gain those yards," he thought<br>
"I’ve got to move real fast."<br><br>

Exerting everything he had <br>
He regained eight or ten.<br>
But trying so hard to catch the lead<br>
He slipped and fell again!<br><br>
Defeat! He lied there silently<br>
—A tear dropped from his eye—<br>
"There’s no sense running anymore<br>
Three strikes; I’m out; Why try?"<br><br>
The will to rise had disappeared<br>
All hope had fled away.<br>
So far behind; so error prone<br>
A loser all the way.<br><br>
"I’ve lost, so what’s the use," he thought<br>
"I’ll live with my disgrace."<br>
But then he thought about his dad<br>
Who soon he’d have to face.<br><br>
"Get up." An echo sounded low<br>
"Get up and take your place.<br>
You were not meant for failure here.<br>
Get up and win the race."<br><br>
"With borrowed will get up," it said:<br>
"You haven’t lost at all.<br>
For winning is no more than this:<br>
To rise each time you fall."<br><br>
So up he rose once more<br>
And with a new commit.<br>
He resolved that win or lose<br>
At least he wouldn’t quit.<br><br>
So far behind the others now<br>
—The most he’d ever been—<br>
Still he gave it all he had<br>
And ran as though to win.<br><br>
Three times he’d fallen, stumbling<br>
Three times he rose again.<br>
Too far behind to hope to win<br>
He still ran to the end.<br><br>
They cheered the winning runner<br>
As he crossed the line first place.<br>
Head high, and proud, and happy<br>
No failing; no disgrace.<br><br>
But when the fallen youngster<br>
Crossed the line—Last place—<br>
The crowd gave him the greater cheer<br>
For finishing the race.<br><br>
And even though he came in last<br>
With head bowed low, not proud.<br>
You would have thought he’d won the race<br>
To listen to the crowd.<br><br>
And to his dad he sadly said<br>
"I didn’t do so well."<br>
"To me you won," his father said<br>
"You rose each time you fell."<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;||<br><br>
And now when things seem dark and hard<br>
And difficult to face.<br>
The memory of that little boy<br>
Helps me in my race.<br><br>
For all of life is like that race<br>
With ups and downs and all.<br>
And all you have to do to win<br>
Is rise each time you fall.<br><br>
"Quit! Give up! You’re beaten!"<br>
They still shout in my face.<br>
But another voice within me says:<br>
"Get up and win the race!"<br><br>
