                                <p>
                                    Like last year, we are going to play paintball for the majority of the day at the Desert Edge "Island" field in Eagle Mountain. There are actually two fields to choose from: <a href="http://www.teamdesertedge.com/content/view/105/114/">"The Island"</a> and <a href="http://www.teamdesertedge.com/content/view/106/115/">"New World"</a>. If one is in-use, we can go to the other. If both are in-use, then there are other locations near this area that can work. Getting to the field requires a high-clearance vehicle, unless of course the giant ditch we crossed last year was magically filled in. So we will meet at Hidden Vallery Elementary at 9:00 and shuttle everyone in and back out.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There will be plenty of water, but no food - although there might be a cake. Maybe some party hats too. So bring your own food/water/gun/mask/paintballs/whatever. The $34 cost gets you a Tippman 98 semi-automatic gun, face mask, 1000 paintballs, and unlimited air. Of course, if all you need are paintballs, then you're looking at something like $15 for 1000 paintballs (I'll have to check and see how much they cost on their own). We are renting from <a href="http://www.saintspaintball.com" target="other">Saints Paintball</a> in Provo.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    It might be cold, but hopefully the temperature will be just right. Getting hit by paintballs can hurt, so you could bring a long-sleeve shirt and pants. If the weather is nice, I'll probably just wear shorts and a t-shirt. The area is dusty and there are some prickly weeds in places, so wearing shorts might result in some dirty, scratched legs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    And finally, <strong>don't forget to fill out the waiver and to pay before October 24</strong>. See ya at Desert Edge!

                                    <strong>Team Elimination</strong><br>
                                    The classic paintball game: Split into two or more teams. Each team tries to eliminate all other teams. Last team standing wins.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Free-For-All</strong><br>
                                    All players have named index cards and must surrender theirs upon elimination. The player with the most cards wins. Works best when a time limit is imposed.

                                    Players hunt only for the person whose card they have. Eliminated players surrender their card which becomes the eliminator’s next target. Any player who tags the wrong person is eliminated from the game and surrenders their target card to the person whom they wrongfully tagged, who then gains a second target.

                                    Each team has a flag and must defend it while trying to capture the opposing team’s flag and return it to their base. Each team has a jail where captured players are kept until freed. Flag carriers drop the flag when they are tagged.

                                    Each team tries to capture and return a single, centralized flag to their base. Players are not eliminated, but must go to a certain check-in point to return to the game. Flag carriers drop the flag when they are tagged.

                                    One or two players start as the zombies. Humans who are tagged announce they have been turned into a zombie and are out-of-play for 10 seconds. Zombies who are tagged by humans are eliminated. The game ends when all zombies or humans are eliminated.

                                    A player wears a target and can only be eliminated when hit on that target. The terminator has a few body guards and wins if he eliminates all opposing players.

                                    One team attempts to rescue and return a seated, unarmed player from another team. If the unarmed player is tagged at any time then the captors win. The captors may shoot at the unarmed player if he stands on his own or if the rescuers enter a specified area.
